# Virtual Reality Nanodegree
### Project for Course02 

1. Name
	* Jihwan Park

2. The time required for this project
	* About 3 hours

3. The most Interesting Issue
	* I could create various animation effect mixing basic transforms, and mecanim provides easy way to control animation.
	  

4. The most challenging Issue
	* It takes most of the time setting up numbers of lights and regulating the values 
	  to get acceptable lightmap. 
	  Especially, spotligth rarely affect to ligth effect with its default intensity value(1) and angles, so
	  I need to test sevearl time to get proper effect(Intensity: 3 / Angles: 60).
	  
	* Also, I found that when I set directional light in real time, It seems to olny affect to non-static object(ex. globe)
	  but when I look into teaching materials, directional light affects to not only non-static objects, but also static objects.
	  I tried to find out reason, but failed to get exact answer. so it will be grateful if you explain the reason.
